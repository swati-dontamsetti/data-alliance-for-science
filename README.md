# Education and Living Conditions

## Background
We were interested in seeing whether a location's High School graduation rate is affected by other living conditions such as the number of children a woman has or life expectancy.

Initially we tried to do this solely in the United States, and to compare state by state data, or even district by district data within one state. Unfortunately finding that data was difficult. The one instance in which we found the data on https://www.data.gov/, the data was 10 years old and the formatting was completely inconsistent. It would take too long to clean the data.

In the end we found "The State of the Worldâ€™s Children 2019 Statistical Tables" on UNICEF at https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/sowc-2019-statistical-tables/.

This thorough and detailed data allowed us to continue with out object of seeing whether a myriad of living conditions affected a locations high school graduation data. Instead of focusing on the US or on a specific state, we focused bigger on country by country basis.
