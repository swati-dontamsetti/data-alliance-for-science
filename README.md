# Education and Living Conditions
##### Group Members: Swati Dontamsetti (Project Manager), Tyler Neher, Todd M, Steven Kilawattie

## Background
We were interested in seeing whether a location's High School graduation rate is affected by other living conditions such as the number of children a woman has or life expectancy.

Initially we tried to do this solely in the United States, and to compare state by state data, or even district by district data within one state. Unfortunately finding that data was difficult. The one instance in which we found the data on https://www.data.gov/, the data was 10 years old and the formatting was completely inconsistent. It would take too long to clean the data.

In the end we found "The State of the Worldâ€™s Children 2019 Statistical Tables" on UNICEF at https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/sowc-2019-statistical-tables/.

This thorough and detailed data allowed us to continue with out object of seeing whether a myriad of living conditions affected a locations high school graduation data. Instead of focusing on the US or on a specific state, we focused bigger on country by country basis. And because we graduation rates were separated by male and female, we are able to see if these different living conditions affected men and women differently.

## Motivation:
Education is commonly touted as the great equalizer of people. Education is meant to help people out of poverty. And the more educated a country is, the better the living conditions are supposed to be in that country. We wanted to see if the data supported these claims. Can we demonstrate actual relationships between how educated a country was and whether or not the people had access to drinking water.

Our hypothesis was that education does affect a country's living conditions.

## Questions asked:
* What 10 countries have the highest graduation rates?
* Do people move to OR move out of a country based on the country's graduation rate?
* Does breastfeeding a child reflect on the country's graduation rate?
* Does life expectancy increase as a country's graduation rate increases?
* If a country's young are malnutritioned, does this reflect on the country's graduation rate?
* Do women have more or less children as the country's graduation rate gets higher?
* Does having access to drinking water affect a country's graduation rates?
* Does having access to sanitation services affect a country's graduation rates?

Each group member took two questions and represented that data with either bar graphs or scatter plot with a linear regression line. The Jupyter Notebook (and the individual data folder) shows who took which questions.
